### More about Concord

<a href="http://docs.fargo.io/outlinerHowto">An outliner</a> is a text editor that organizes information in a hierarchy, allowing users to control the level of detail and to reorganize according to structure. Your notes can have full detail, yet be organized so a casual reader can get a quick overview. Outlining is a great way for teams to organize work.
